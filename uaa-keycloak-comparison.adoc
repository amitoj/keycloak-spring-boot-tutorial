This document tries to offer a comparison table between features that are available in {cf-uaa} (version *{cf-uaa-version}*) and/or {keycloak} (*{keycloak-current-version}*).

== Introduction

When considering an SSO platform, we should analyze the following aspects/ requirements:

* <<sso>>
* <<standard-protocols>>
* <<centralized-management>>
* <<adapters>>
* <<ldap-ad>>
* <<social-login>>
* <<identity-brokering>>
* <<high-performance>>
* <<clustering>>
* <<themes>>
* <<extensible>>
* <<password-policies>>

[[sso]]
=== Single-Sing On

Support for login once to multiple applications.

The platform also should support for Single-Sign Out, which means that it should have options to force the log out of a single user (or all users) of the system.

[[standard-protocols]]
=== Standard Protocols

Use of standard protocols like {openid-connect}, {oauth2} and {saml} 2.0.

[[centralized-management]]
=== Centralized Management

Availability and features for admins and users.

The platform should offer features like:

* Determine how many active sessions our system currently has.
* Options to force the logout of a single user (or all users) of the system.
* Centralized password policy
* One time password (OTP) policies
* Authorization policies per resource or per scope
* Timed access policy (users or group of users can login only between certain time slots)
* JavaScript-Based policy
* Rule-Based policy

[[adapters]]
=== Adapters

Extensibility points to add secure applications and services easily.

The SSO platform should offer adapters (libraries that makes it very easy to secure applications and service) for the application platforms we use: Spring Boot and JavaScript.

[[ldap-ad]]
=== LDAP and Active Directory

Facility to do integration with existing user directories.

The platform should support Kerberos logins and federate LDAP or Active Directory in just one configuration page.

[[social-login]]
=== Social Login

The platform should enable us to login using social networks like Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc.

[[identity-brokering]]
=== Identity Brokering

{openid-connect} and {saml} 2.0 IdPs.

[[high-performance]]
=== High Performance

Lightweight, fast and scalable.

[[clustering]]
=== Clustering

For scalability and availability.

[[themes]]
=== Themes

Customize look and feel.

[[extensible]]
=== Extensible

Customize through code.

The platform should be extensible enabling we to write our own authenticator or federator.
We should have options to integrate our own code that authenticate a user with SSL client certificate.
Also, maybe we should integrate a user database from a legacy system and use it as an identity source.

[[password-policies]]
=== Password Policies

Customize password policies.

////
=== Adaptability

To speed up development, it is fine that the solution uses an embedded datastore by default.
But, for production envinronents we would like to be free to use our own database (Postgree or Oracle).

//By fault, Keycloak uses the open source H2 database as its embedded datastore.
//However, you are free to choose your own database: Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2 , MySQL/MariaDB, or PostgreSQL.

=== Scalability

The platform must be scalable.

//Keycloak use the Wildfly Clustering features which means you can use Infinispan (aka Red Hat JBoss DataGrid) caching to have clustered instances with sessions replicated across all the machines in the cluster.

=== Extensibility

The platform must be extensible enabling we to write our own authenticator or federator.

//The Keycloak Service provider interface, enables you to write your own authenticator or federator.
//You could use the authenticator, to integrate your own code that authenticate a user with SSL client certificate.
//Using the federator, you could integrate the user database from a legacy system and use it as an identity source in Keycloak.

=== Centralization

The platform should offer a centralized session management where it's possible:

* Determine how many active sessions our system currently has.
* Options to force the logout of a single user (or all users) of the system.

Logout All Limitations: Any SSO cookies set will be invalid and clients that request authentication in active browser sessions will now have to re-login.
Only certain clients are notified of this logout event, specifically clients that are using the Keycloak OIDC client adapter.
Other client types (i.e. {saml}) will not receive a backchannel logout request.
