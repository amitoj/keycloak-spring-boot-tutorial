This tutorial explains some {keycloak} (version {keycloak-version}) concepts by doing some practical labs.
The primary focus of these labs is to explain how {spring-boot} applications can be secured by Keycloak.

== Lab 1 - Setup a local development environment and start Keycloak

Create dir and download keycloak.

----
$ wget -c https://downloads.jboss.org/keycloak/4.6.0.Final/keycloak-4.6.0.Final.tar.gz
----

Setup JDK to use ({jdk-version}).

----
$ sdk default java 11.0.1-open
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13, mixed mode)
----

NOTE: `sdk` ({sdkman}) is a command line too used in this tutorial to set up the JDK version used.

Extract keycloak:

----
$ tar xvfz keycloak-4.6.0.Final.tar.gz
----

Configure the KEYCLOAK_HOME and set the PATH for its binaries:

----
$ cat > bashrc << EOF
export KEYCLOAK_LAB=$PWD
export KEYCLOAK_HOME=\$KEYCLOAK_LAB/keycloak-4.6.0.Final
export PATH=\$KEYCLOAK_HOME/bin:\$PATH
EOF
$ source $PWD/bashrc
$ echo "!!" >> ~/.bash_profile
----

Extract and run keycloak.

----
$ $KEYCLOAK_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
----

Open http://localhost:8180 and configure the user and password to access de `Administration Console`.

//$ kcadm.sh config credentials --server http://localhost:8080/auth --realm master --user admin --password admin

== Lab 2 - Run some quickstarts

Clone https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts[keycloak-quickstarts].

----
$ git clone https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts.git
$ cd keycloak-quickstarts
$ git checkout 4.6.0.Final
$ git apply ../../patches/`basename $PWD`/pom.xml
----

[[app-authz-rest-springboot]]
=== Lab: app-authz-rest-springboot

The https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts/tree/latest/app-authz-rest-springboot[app-authz-rest-springboot] quickstart
demonstrates how to protect a Spring Boot REST service using Keycloak Authorization Services.

This quickstart tries to focus on the authorization features provided by Keycloak Authorization Services,
where resources are protected by a set of permissions and policies defined in Keycloak
and access to these resources are enforced by a policy enforcer (PEP)
that intercepts every single request sent to the application to check whether or not access should be granted.

In this application, there are three paths protected by specific permissions in Keycloak:

* `*/api/{resource}*`, where access to this resource is based on the evaluation of permissions associated with a resource *Default Resource* in Keycloak.
Basically, any user with a role user is allowed to access this resource.
Examples of resource that match this path pattern are: `/api/resourcea` and `/api/resourceb`.
* `*/api/premium*`, where access to this resource is based on the evaluation of permissions associated with a resource *Premium Resource* in Keycloak.
Basically, only users with a role user-premium is allowed to access this resource.
* `*/api/admin*`, where access to this path is based on the evaluation of permissions associated with a resource *Admin Resource* in Keycloak.
Basically, any user can access this resource as long as a specific request parameter is set.

We can use two distinct users to access this application:

[[users]]
[options="header"]
|===
| Username | Password | Roles
| alice    | alice    | user
| jdoe     | jdoe     | user, user-premium
|===

Let's change to the application directory:

----
$ cd app-authz-rest-springboot
----

We need to import the file `config/quickstart-realm.json`.
To do this, click in `Add realm` button:

image::keycloak-add-realm.png[]

Then import the file by clicking on `Select file` button:

image::keycloak-add-realm-select-file.png[]

NOTE: We can click on `View details` to see more information about the realm that we are adding.

We need to click `Save`.

Now, let's run the Spring Boot app:

----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

Backing to the dir `~/labs/keycloak`, let's obtain the OAuth2 access token for user `alice`:

----
$ cd $KEYCLOAK_LAB
$ curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/spring-boot-quickstart/protocol/openid-connect/token \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic YXBwLWF1dGh6LXJlc3Qtc3ByaW5nYm9vdDpzZWNyZXQ=' \
  -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'username=alice&password=alice&grant_type=password' \
  | jq -r .access_token > alice.access_token
----

[NOTE]
====
. The parameter `Authorization` is a base 64 encoded string which can be decoded as follows:
+
----
$ echo 'YXBwLWF1dGh6LXJlc3Qtc3ByaW5nYm9vdDpzZWNyZXQ=' | base64 -D
app-authz-rest-springboot:secret
----
. `{jq} -r` is used to get only the value for the `access_token` field in the returned JSON.
. The value of the field `access_token` will be inserted in a file with the corresponding name.

====

Let's install a Node.js {uri-jwt-rfc}[JSON Web Token (JWT)^] decoder ({jwt-cli}) in order to inspect the contents of the `access_token`:

----
$ npm install -g jwt-cli
----

Now let's use it:

----
$ jwt $(cat alice.access_token)
----

[NOTE]
====
There are many other alternatives tools to decode a JWT.
Here are some links:

* https://jwt.io
* https://github.com/mike-engel/jwt-cli
* https://github.com/emcrisostomo/jwt-cli
* https://gist.github.com/angelo-v/e0208a18d455e2e6ea3c40ad637aac53
====

By inspecting the contents of the `alice.access_token` we can see that it will be valid only for 5 min (fields `iat` and `exp`).
If we try to use it again after this period, we will see an error appearing in the console of the Spring Boot Application:

----
ERROR 5729 --- [nio-8080-exec-6] o.k.a.BearerTokenRequestAuthenticator    : Failed to verify token

org.keycloak.exceptions.TokenNotActiveException: Token is not active
----

We can configure the value of `Access Token Lifespan` field if we want to increase this period.

image::keycloak-access-token-config.png[]

So, let's update the this max time to 10 minutes.
After that, we run the following command to get he OAuth2 access token for the user `jdoe`:

----
$ curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/spring-boot-quickstart/protocol/openid-connect/token \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic YXBwLWF1dGh6LXJlc3Qtc3ByaW5nYm9vdDpzZWNyZXQ=' \
  -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'username=jdoe&password=jdoe&grant_type=password' \
  | jq -r .access_token > jdoe.access_token
----

==== Accessing Protected Resources using an OAuth2 Access Token

Let's try access the `api/resourcea` using the token received for `alice`:

----
$ curl -v -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/resourcea -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat alice.access_token)"
----

We expect the following response: `Access Granted`.

[NOTE]
====
. We can change `resourcea` to `resourceb` in the request and we can see the same response.
. The access to the resources `/api/admin` or `/api/premium` we will be denied.
====

Using the token received for `jdoe` we can also access the `/api/premium` resource:

----
$ curl -v -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/premium -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat jdoe.access_token)"
----

=== Lab: app-authz-springboot

The https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts/tree/latest/app-authz-springboot[app-authz-springboot] quickstart demonstrates how to write a SpringBoot Web application where both authentication and authorization aspects are managed by Keycloak.

This application tries to focus on the authorization features provided by Keycloak Authorization Services, where resources are protected by a set of permissions and policies defined in Keycloak itself and access to these resources are enforced by a policy enforcer that intercepts every single request to the application.

In this application, there are three paths protected by specific permissions in Keycloak:

* `*/protected*`, where access to this page is based on the evaluation of permissions associated with a resource *Protected Resource* in Keycloak. Basically, any user with a role user is allowed to access this page.
* `*/protected/premium*`, where access to this page is based on the evaluation of permissions associated with a resource *Premium Resource* in Keycloak. Basically, only users with a role user-premium is allowed to access this page.
* `*/protected/alice*`, where access to this page is based on the evaluation of permissions associated with a resource *Alice Resource* in Keycloak. Basically, only user alice is allowed to access this page.

The home page (`home.ftl`) also demonstrates how to use a `AuthorizationContext` instance to check for user`s permissions and hide/show things in a page. Where the `AuthorizationContext` encapsulates all permissions granted by a Keycloak server and provides methods to check these permissions.

We can use the same <<users,users>> registered in the previous lab with the same password and roles.

==== Configuration in Keycloak

We need to delete the previously configured realm: `spring-boot-quickstart`.

Then we need to recreate the realm:

* In the top left corner dropdown menu that is titled Master, click Add Realm.
If you are logged in to the master realm this dropdown menu lists all the realms created.
* Click on Select File and import the file `keycloak-quickstarts/app-authz-springboot/config/quickstart-realm.json`.
* Click Create.

==== Build and Run

First, stop the execution for the last lab (<<app-authz-rest-springboot>>) if it is already running!

Then, start the microservice for this lab:

----
$ cd keycloak-quickstarts/app-authz-springboot/
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

Open http://localhost:8080.
Test the app using the usernames provided (`alice` and `jdoe`).
